# requirements.txt for Smart Resume Analyzer (Deep Learning Version)

streamlit>=1.10.0
pandas>=1.4.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0  # For TF-IDF, ML model loading, cosine_similarity
nltk>=3.7
pypdf>=3.1.0         # For PDF text extraction (replaces pdfminer.six if you switched fully)
# OR if still using pdfminer.six based pdf_reader:
# pdfminer.six>=20221105
python-docx>=0.8.11  # For DOCX text extraction
Pillow>=9.0.0        # Image handling, often a dependency
streamlit-tags>=1.2.5
pymysql>=1.0.0       # If using database functionality
plotly>=5.5.0        # For charts in the admin panel
numpy>=1.21.0        # Numerical operations, used for argmax with model predictions

# Deep Learning Libraries
spacy>=3.0.0
# Note: The spaCy model (e.g., en_core_web_sm) must be downloaded separately:
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

transformers>=4.20.0 # For summarization pipeline, sentencepiece often useful for tokenizers
# Choose one backend for Transformers:
torch>=1.10.0        # PyTorch backend (recommended for many Hugging Face models)
# OR
# tensorflow>=2.8.0  # TensorFlow backend (if you prefer/configured it)

# Optional: If you implemented semantic similarity with Sentence-BERT (Option 1 from earlier discussion)
# sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Optional: If you still use pyresparser for anything (e.g., basic info extraction as a fallback)
# pyresparser>=0.6

# If you keep the commented-out video features or use them:
# pafy>=0.5.5
# youtube-dl>=2021.12.17 # or yt-dlp
# yt-dlp>=2023.03.04
